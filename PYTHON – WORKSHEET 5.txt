11. List: Lists are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful
          tool in Python. The main characteristics of lists are –

          * The list is a datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.

          * List are mutable .i.e it can be converted into another data type and can store any data element in it.

          * List can store any type of element.

    Set: In Python, Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that 
         it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set. The main characteristics of set are –

         * Sets are an unordered collection of elements or unintended collection of items In python.

         * Here the order in which the elements are added into the set is not fixed, it can change frequently.



         * It is defined under curly braces{}

         * Sets are mutable, however, only immutable objects can be stored in it.


    Differences between lists and sets in python :-


         LIST                                              SET

         * Lists is Mutable                                * Set is Mutable

         * It is Ordered collection of items               * It is Unordered collection of items

         * Items in list can be replaced or changed        * Items in set cannot be changed or replaced
